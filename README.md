**My favorite series is the Saw franchise**
- The Saw franchise revolves around John Kramer, a serial killer which puts his "victims" to his deadly traps instead of outright killing them.
- John Kramer typically puts his subjects on what he calls a "test" or a "game" in which he tests his subjects' will to live. His games normally involve psychological or physical torture.
